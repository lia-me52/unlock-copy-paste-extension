# Unlock Copy and Paste Chrome Extension  
Unlock the ability to copy and paste content on websites that block these actions. This extension bypasses restrictions such as right-click block, text selection disablement, and more, allowing users to freely copy, paste, and select text.

## ✨ Features ✨

- 🌐 Unlock **copy** and **paste** functionality on any website.
- 💻 Re-enable **right-click** (context menu) functionality on restricted websites.
- 📄 Enable **text selection** even if a website has disabled it.
- 🔒 Remove restrictions from **key events** such as Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, and `copy`/`paste` commands.
- 🎨 Works seamlessly on all types of websites, including blogs, educational sites, news outlets, and more.

### Usage

Once installed, the extension automatically starts working on pages that restrict copying, right-clicking, and text selection.

- **Right-click** will now work on all pages that previously blocked it.
- **Select text** freely, even when websites try to prevent selection.
- Use **Ctrl+C** and **Ctrl+V** to copy and paste without limitations.

You can easily test the extension on websites that normally block copying, such as news websites, academic platforms, and more.
